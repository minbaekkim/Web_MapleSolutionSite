(a) If f(x,y)=yâ€Šex , find the rate of change of fat the point P(0,3 ) in the direction from P to Q(12,8 ).
                         41/13 (25%)
(b) In what direction does f have the maximum rate of change? What is this maximum rate of change?
Unit Direction Vector : <12/13 (25%),5/13 (25%)>
Maximium rate of change : sqrt(10) (25%)

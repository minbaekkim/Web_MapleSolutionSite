The temperature at a point (x,y,z)is given by
            T(x,y,z)=600 e−3 x2−4 y2−8 z2
where Tis measured in oC and x,y,zin meters.
(a) Find the rate of change of temperature at the point P(4,-4,3)in the direction toward the point (1,-1,1).
 1200/sqrt(22)e^(-184)(36+48+48) (25%)oC/m
(b) In which direction does the temperature increase fastest at P.
< -12, 16 (25%), -24 (25%)>
(c) Find the maximum rate of increase at P.
1200e^(-184)*sqrt(12^2+16^2+24^2) (25%) oC/m

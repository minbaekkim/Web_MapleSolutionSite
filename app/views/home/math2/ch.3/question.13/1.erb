a) Find a vector equation and parametric equation for the line segment that joins the point P(−1,1,−1 ) to the point Q( −4,−3,3 ) 
Solution A vector equation for the line segment that joins the tip of vector r0 to the tip of the vector r1 is
             r(t)=(1−t)r0+tr1            0≤t≤1
 We take r0=<−1,1,−1 > and r1=< -4 (8%) ,  -3 (8%) ,  3 (8%) > to obtain a vector equation of the line segment from P to Q :
              r(t)=(1−t)<−1,1,−1 >+t< -4 (8%) ,  -3 (8%) , 3 (8%) >        0≤t≤1
             r(t)=< -1-3*t (8%) , 1-4*t (8%) , -1+4*t (8%) >     0≤t≤1
The corresponding parametric equations are
           x= -1-3*t (8%)      y= 1-4*t (8%)      z= -1+4*t (8%)              0≤t≤1

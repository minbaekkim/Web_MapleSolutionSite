Find a parametric representation for the surface which is the part of the cylinder x2+y2+z2=4 that lies between the planes z=−1 and z=1 .
Solution : In spherical coordinates, parametric equations are x=2 sin(s) cos(t) , y= 2*sin(s)*sin(t) (17%), z= 2cos(s) (17%)  , The intersection of the sphere with the plane z=−1 corresponds to s= pi/3 (17%) . By symmetry, the intersection of the sphere with plane z=1 corresponds to s=  2*pi/3 (17%) . Thus the surface is described by 0≤t≤2π and  pi/3 (17%) ≤s≤ 2*pi/3 (17%) .
